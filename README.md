# Faculty's website

This project aims at creating a website for a faculty member at a College setting. A number of tools to help with the delivery of courses will be included such as: a template to create presentation slides, a tool to allow students and/or groups of students to pick meeting timeslots, tools for allowing faculty and groups to easily message one another, and a timetable for the faculty to display its availability to students. To make use of these tools, a login system will also need to be implemented.

This wesite will be created using Django at its back-end and employing a simple SQLite database. At its front end, the only frameworks used are JQuery for functionality (I know, I am getting old and obsolete), and Bootstrap for its CSS.
